As you can see, the front yard isn't to shabby either.\n\nThe Mesquite Dune Field is located just across the street from Stove Pipe Wells. The field is very large - approximately 3 miles by 5 miles but throughout most of that area, the sand is fairly thin with just long wavelength, low amplitude dunes. At the southern end of the dune field, however, the dunes are much larger.\nSunset presents many opportunities: high contrast, golden, direct light; rosy, soft, indirect light; a bounce alpenglow light; and if it is a full moon, a cool, blue version of daylight.\n\nThis is the golden direct light, casting deep shadows and accentuating those sinuous dune crests. \n\nS0A9453","license":"0","dateupload":"1389229655","datetaken":"2013-11-17 19:00:17","datetakengranularity":"0","ownername":"E=mcSCOW","iconserver":"7443","iconfarm":8,"originalsecret":"777609d126","originalformat":"jpg","lastupdate":"1389317950","latitude":36.606226,"longitude":-117.110394,"accuracy":"14","context":0,"place_id":"obRYb.ZTWrkTWgyzRw","woeid":"28337769","geo_is_family":0,"geo_is_friend":0,"geo_is_contact":0,"geo_is_public":1,"tags":"sunset sanddune stovepipewells deathvalleynationalpark stardune mesquitedunes vision:mountain=0518 vision:beach=0525 vision:sunset=0886 vision:outdoor=0824 vision:sky=0971 vision:clouds=0972 vision:car=073 vision:ocean=0871","machine_tags":"","o_width":"2000","o_height":"1065","views":"12225","media":"photo","media_status":"ready","pathalias":null,"url_sq":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_t.jpg","height_t":"53","width_t":"100","url_s":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_m.jpg","height_s":"128","width_s":"240","url_q":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931.jpg","height_m":"266","width_m":"500","url_n":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_n.jpg","height_n":170,"width_n":"320","url_z":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_z.jpg","height_z":"341","width_z":"640","url_c":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_c.jpg","height_c":426,"width_c":"800","url_l":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_8a68b47931_b.jpg","height_l":"545","width_l":"1024","url_o":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11846623296_777609d126_o.jpg","height_o":"1065","width_o":"2000"}
